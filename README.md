# SRGAN-tensorflow-2.0

SRGAN is a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image resolution (Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network
). As per the research paper, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4X upscaling factors. This project contains the SRGAN implementation using tensorflow 2.0
